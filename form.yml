# @note Used to define the submitted cluster, title, description, and

# **MUST** set cluster id here that matches cluster configuration file located
# under /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/*.yml
# @example Use the Owens cluster at Ohio Supercomputer Center
#     cluster: "owens"
cluster: "myriad"

# Define attribute values that aren't meant to be modified by the user within
# the Dashboard form
attributes:
  # Set the corresponding modules that need to be loaded for Jupyter to run
  #
  # @note It is called within the batch job as `module load <modules>` if
  #   defined
  # @example Do not load any modules
  #     modules: ""
  # @example Using default python module
  #     modules: "python"
  # @example Using specific python module
  #     modules: "python/3.5"
  # @example Using combination of modules
  #     modules: "python/3.5 cuda/8.0.44"
  modules: "julia/1.10.1"

  # Any extra command line arguments to feed to the `julia ...`
  # command that launches the Julia exec within the batch job
  extra_julia_args: ""

  # These probably need to be pulled out and put somewhere they can be inherited from
